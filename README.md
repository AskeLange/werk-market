## Branching strategy

- All branches are created from **dev**
- Larger features are created in a new branch, and tested on **dev** before merged into **main**
- Remember to make pull requests for features and larger issues.
- When committing, please use conventional commits (https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary)
